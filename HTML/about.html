  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am a certified Data Analyst from the IBM edX platform. I completed my higher secondary education at Saraswati Gyan Mandir (SGM) Science College, and I am currently pursuing my B.Tech 3rd year <br> at NM Institute of Engineering & Technology.</p>
  <p>I love working with data and have built many small SQL projects to solve real-world problems. Beyond analytics, I enjoy dancing and playing badminton. I’m a food lover—especially fond of eggs, chicken, and paneer dishes. <br>Exploring new places is my passion; Uttarakhand is one of my favorite places. My dream of visiting Varanasi, Mathura, Vrindavan in Uttar Pradesh, and the mystical Dwarka in Gujarat, located beneath the sea. Given the chance, I'd love to travel and experience these spiritual and historical places.</p>
